Content - New and Old
# ðŸ“š Content Repository

This repo is a central hub for my past, current, and future content.  
Itâ€™s designed to keep originals in one place, track repurposing ideas, and serve as a library I can pull from when creating new assets.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Archive content that is no longer online (keep the originals safe).  
- Track where and how content has been repurposed.  
- Brainstorm new ways to remix content into fresh formats (video, snippet, article, social post, etc.).  
- Provide a single reference point for ongoing content strategy.  


---

## ðŸ›  How to Use This Repo
- Add new content entries as issues (tag with `#repurpose` or `#archive`).  
- Use tables to track repurposing status (âœ… = done, â¬œ = to-do).  
- Keep notes on which pieces were most effective in each format.  
- Treat this repo as a **living content library** â†’ build once, reuse often.
